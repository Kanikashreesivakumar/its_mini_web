        <p style="color:white"> On the banks of the river that flows alone, I called out your name. Beside the train that runs alone, I called out your name. When the train went far away, And the time passed, I shed tears."Iâ€™m really sorry to hear that youâ€™re not feeling well. Please take all the time you need to rest and recover, as your health is the most important thing right now. Remember, itâ€™s perfectly okay to slow down and focus on getting better. If thereâ€™s anything you needâ€”whether itâ€™s help with errands, a comforting conversation, or just some quiet supportâ€”please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. Youâ€™ve got this, and weâ€™re all here cheering you on. Get well soon!
